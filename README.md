# PARALLEL AND SEQUENTIAL PROGRAMMING 
# OVERVIEW 
This is to measure performance between parallel programming and sequential programming testing quality and the time taken for data to be processed with the different methods of processing techniques. 

PROJECT GOALS: 
Data Processing: With the data given by our client,  the next step is to process the datasets using sequential and parallel processing. 
Data Analysis: Once the data is processed, the next goal is to analyse it using various statistical and learning techniques such as R Studio and MATLAB. This can involve identifying patterns, trends, and correlations in the data, as well as building predictive models.
Data Visualization: The use of flowcharts, tables, and graphs has allowed to draw appropriate and accurate conclusions  which will be communicated to The insights gained from the data analysis can be communicated to the client. 
Software Development: Finally,  we go  through the final stages of development that include break testing and automated testing to check for errors and as well keep up with up to date patterns and climate trends.
This big data project aims to extract insights and value from large volumes of data, with the goal of informing decision-making, storing information and improving the clientâ€™s security and organisation of data.


# REQUIREMENTS 
MATLAB R2021a or newer

# SEQUENTIAL PROGRAMMING 
With Sequential programming, tasks are executed one at each time where each line of code waits for the previous one to be complemeted before starting a new one. It is simple to write and decode 
# PARALLEL PROGRAMMING 
# PERFORMANCE
